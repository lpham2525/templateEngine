Visual Aid: ![Example](./example.png?raw=true "Team Roster")
--------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Template Engine! This handy application generates team rosters for quick and accessible information on each team member. 

How It Works:
--------------------------------------------------------------
The app asks users a series of questions about each person on their engineering team in order to create an organized, readable roster. The team can be any combination of managers, engineers, and interns with a role-specific question for each member. Once all information has been collected from the user, the template engine will assemble an HTML page which exhibits information about each member on a formatted card.
