Template Engine

 This application will ask users a series of questions about each person on their engineering team in order to create a team roster. The team can be a combination of managers, engineers, and interns and there is a role-specific question for each member. Once all information has been collected from the user, the template engine will assemble an HTML page which exhibits information about each member on a formatted card.
